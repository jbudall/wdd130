            <p>Hello, my name is Jaren Udall. I am from Mesa, Arizona. I have lived in Arizona all my life with the
                exception
                of my mission. I served in the Birmingham, Alabama Mission, English speaking. I have been married for
                almost
                four years and we are
                about to welcome our first baby in March of 2026. I am currently working as a pest control technician. I
                enjoy reading, watching TV shows and movies with my
                wife, and yoyoing. I also enjoy playing card and board games and some video games (specifically
                multiplayer
                games on the Wii). The picture above is me
                doing a yoyo trick called the "DNA" in front of a black light
                that makes the string glow. If you are interested in seeing super cool yoyo tricks, look up Gentry Stein
                World Yoyo Contest on YouTube. I am nowhere close to as good as this guy, and I don't compete, but it is
                a
                lot of fun learning new tricks. I am studying at BYU Pathway, working towards a degree in software
                development. Currently, I am learning the basics of web development, specifically HTML,
                python, and SQL databases. I am excited to learn how to program and learn the necessary skills to be a
                full
                stack developer.</p>

            <p>Arizona has a couple different terrains. In northern Arizona, there are pine trees and forests and snow
                in
                the
                winter. There is also plains with inactive volcanoes in another part of the state. The part of Arizona
                that
                I live in is just desert with cacti everywhere. In the summers, it reaches up to 118 degrees F and in
                the
                winters, it only gets down to about 40 degrees F. It is a great place to live.</p>
