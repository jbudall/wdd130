        <p>Hello, my name is Jaren Udall. I am from Mesa, Arizona. I have been married for almost four years and we are
            about to welcome our first baby in March of 2026. I am currently working as a pest control technician. I
            enjoy reading, watching TV shows and movies with my
            wife, and yoyoing. The picture above is me doing a yoyo trick called the "DNA" in front of a black light
            that makes the string glow. I am studying at BYU Pathway, working towards a degree in software
            development. Currently, I am learning the basics of web development, specifically HTML,
            python, and SQL databases. I am excited to learn how to program learn the necessary skills to be a full
            stack
            developer.</p>

        <p>Arizona has a couple different terrains. In northern Arizona, there are pine trees and forests and snow in
            the
            winter. There is also plains with inactive volcanoes in another part of the state. The part of Arizona that
            I live in is just desert with cacti everywhere. In the summers, it reaches up to 118 degrees F and in the
            winters, it only gets down to about 40 degrees F. It is a great place to live.</p>
