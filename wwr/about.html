            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>This company has been in operation since 1965 and was founded by William P. Sherbet. After Sherbet's
                    original plan to start an icecream business failed, he decided his true passion wasn't icecream at
                    all. It was being outside and being active.
                    Sherbet always had a fondness for the outdoors and adventure. He specifically enjoyed river rafting
                    and
                    found it exhilarating. He wanted to share his passion with everyone and help them
                    have
                    new and exciting experiences. Thus, Splash White Water Rafting was born.</p>

                <p>Since 1965, Splash White Water Rafting has grown in size. Growth started off slowly, as the company
                    had to rely mostly on word of mouth, but as social media became big, more people heard about the
                    company. People all across the United States, from
                    all
                    walks of life travel here to experience the untameable wildness of the river. Find out more about
