    <h1>Why is Mesa, Arizona my Favorite City?</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Mesa, Arizona in the United States. It's not my favorite city because the weather is nice or
        the scenery is pretty. In fact, the weather is crazy hot in the summer and the scenery is cacti, bushes, and
        tight clustered
        homes. I have lived in Mesa, Arizona all my life and it is home. There are many things to do here because it is
        big and makes up part of a tight knit cluster of large cities in Arizona called the Valley. The biggest reason
        why it is my
        favorite city, is because it is where my family lives. I get to visit my family often because they all live
        within 20 minutes from me.
    <p> If you are ever looking for a nice, enjoyable place to go on a vacation to, then Mesa, Arizona is not it. This
        summer it hit 118 degrees. If you have to come here, definitely come in the winter when it will only hit about
        60 degrees in the day and 40 degrees at night. I would not say it is the most popular vacation destination.</p>
